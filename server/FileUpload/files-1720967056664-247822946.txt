Steps to Develop the Model
Data Collection:

Corpus Creation: Gather a large dataset of texts written by students from various grade levels. This could include essays, short responses, and other writing samples.
Labeling: Label the data according to the grade level of the students who wrote them.
Feature Extraction:

Vocabulary Frequency: Analyze the frequency of words used in each text.
Lexical Diversity: Measure the variety of unique words used.
Complexity Metrics: Assess the complexity of words based on syllable count, word length, and usage frequency in standard grade-level texts.
Model Selection:

Choose machine learning algorithms suitable for classification tasks. Common choices include decision trees, support vector machines (SVM), and neural networks.
Training the Model:

Supervised Learning: Train the model using labeled datasets where the vocabulary level (grade level) is the target variable.
Feature Engineering: Experiment with different features and combinations to improve the model's accuracy.
Evaluation:

Validation: Use a validation set to tune hyperparameters and avoid overfitting.
Testing: Assess the modelâ€™s performance on an independent test set to ensure it generalizes well to new data.
Deployment:

Once the model is trained and validated, you can use it to assess new student writings to determine their vocabulary level.
